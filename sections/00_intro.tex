\section{Introduction}
This project follows the Kaggle Competition \href{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/understanding_cloud_organization/overview}{"Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images"}, hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in 2019. The stated goal of the competition was to crowd source a way to better identify and label clouds in satellite images. The organizer provided a suite of training images, a \texttt{.csv} of the label masks for each image, and a suite of unlabeled test images \cite{fouhey_2010MachineLearning_2018}.
